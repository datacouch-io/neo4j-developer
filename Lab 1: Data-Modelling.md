# Lab 1: Graph Data Modeling - "Simple E-Commerce System"

## Objective

Design a graph data model for a simple e-commerce platform. The goal is to identify nodes, relationships, and properties, and to draw an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) using a whiteboard or paper.

## Scenario

The system requirements are as follows:

-   Customers can place orders.  
      
    
-   Each order can contain multiple products.  
      
    
-   Each product belongs to a specific category.  
      
    
-   Products are sold by different sellers.  
      
    
-   Customers can write reviews for products, including a rating and a comment.  
      
    
-   Each customer has a profile containing name, email, and address.  
      
    

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Nodes

List all the distinct entities that should exist as nodes in the graph.

Questions to consider:

-   Who are the people or things involved?  
      
    
-   What objects need to be stored separately?
    

  

### Step 2: Identify Relationships

Define how nodes are connected by relationships.

Questions to consider:

-   What actions or links exist between different entities?  
      
    
-   Which node is the starting point, and which is the endpoint of each relationship?
    

  

### Step 3: Identify Properties

For each node and each relationship, identify key properties (attributes) that should be stored.

Questions to consider:

-   What information do we need to know about this node or relationship?
    

  

### Step 4: Draw the ERD (Graph Model)

On a whiteboard or plain paper:

-   Represent nodes as circles.  
      
    
-   Represent relationships as arrows connecting nodes.  
      
    
-   Write properties inside the node or alongside the relationship.  
      
    
-   Clearly label each relationship with a verb or action word (e.g., "PLACED", "CONTAINS").
    

  
  
  

## Submission Requirements

Submit a clear photo or scanned copy of your ERD diagram.

Ensure:

-   All nodes and relationships are properly labeled.  
      
    
-   All properties are clearly indicated.  
      
    
-   The diagram is easy to read.
    

## Important Notes

-   Focus on conceptual design rather than implementation.  
      
    
-   Ensure all critical entities and interactions from the scenario are included.

### ðŸ’¡ Business Questions for Model Evolution

Now that youâ€™ve built your initial model, your

business stakeholders have raised additional analytical needs.

Based on the following questions, evolve your model by introducing new properties, relationships, or labels/sub-labels (hierarchies):

  

**Requirement 1: Customer Reviews Sentiment:**

"Can we analyze the sentiment of customer reviews?"

  

**Requirement 2 Customer Segmentation:**

"Can we analyze customers by their behavior â€“ such as frequency of purchases, average order value?"

  

**Requirement 3: Location-Based Recommendations:**

"Can we recommend local sellers or show delivery time estimates?"
